### Passion Project: **RecipeLinkerList**

* *RecipeLinkerList* is a mobile application that allows the user to enter grocery items for recommended *recipe* suggestions.  
The user starts the application by tapping a button which leads to a main menu. The main menu will have navigation areas such as Create New Grocery List, View Grocery List Data, Update Grocery List, Delete Grocery Lists and *Recipe* *Engine*. 

* When the user creates a grocery list, the information is stored in a database which the recipe engine accesses. *Recipes* are organized by breakfast, lunch and dinner. Depending on the specific ingredients of a *recipe*, the application will share website links for *recipes* along with stored *recipes*.

* The user will be able to select recipes according to type of cuisine. Also the user will be able to locate specific cuisine in surrounding area if not preparing meals.

* The user will also be able to sort suggestions by cuisine type.

* Grocery lists can be modified and deleted which will affect available suggestions. 

* Lists can also be used as a template for grocery shopping instead of searching for recipes.

* Java, javascript, jhipster, typescript, React and SQL will be used for this project.
